Uprated replacement Fuel Injection board for the Cosworth Sierra using the Weber IAW ECU.
Uses ARM Cortex-M7 at 600 MHz for the main processor and two AVRMega324PB configured as SPI slaves.
One to control the Lambda Sensor and Knock sensor, the other to control the Peak and Hold Injectors.
Designed to tap into the ABS sensors to give gear dependant boost control.
